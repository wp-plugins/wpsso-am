<p><strong>Do you have an Apple Store App for your website that you'd like to promote as a banner in Apple's mobile Safari?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Does your website sell one or more Apple Store Apps, and you'd like to support the Twitter App Card for your App product pages?</strong></p>

<p>WPSSO App Meta (WPSSO AM) works in conjunction with the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso/">WordPress Social Sharing Optimization</a> plugin, extending its features with additional settings pages, tabs, and options, to <strong>include iPhone, iPad, and Google Play App meta tags in your webpages</strong> (for Apple's mobile Safari and Twitter's App Card). WPSSO AM is <em>fast</em>, <em>efficient</em>, and &mdash; using WPSSO as its framework &mdash; provides <em>accurate</em> information about your content to social websites.</p>

<p><strong>You can download the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-am/">Free version of WPSSO AM on WordPress.org</a> and <a href="(http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/wpsso-am/">purchase Pro license(s) on SurniaUlula.com</a></strong> (includes a <em>No Risk 30 Day Refund Policy</em>). The banner advertisement feature for mobile Safari is included with the Free version, where-as the Twitter App Card feature is provided with the Pro version.</p>
